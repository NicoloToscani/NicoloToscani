### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm NicolÃ² from Italy and I'm currently working on Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

I graduated in Computer Science while working as an Automation Engineer.
I'm always looking for new solutions to simplify data exchange between OT and IT layers of the manufacturing process.
Support the development of open source software to simplify Industry 4.0 integration.
